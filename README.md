Here's a full step-by-step Python + OpenCV + MediaPipe project to control the PC using hand gestures:
* Thumb & Index finger touch → mouse click
* Hand movement → mouse move
* Two fingers up → increase brightness
* Three fingers up → increase volume
* One finger up → decrease brightness
* Four fingers up → decrease volume
* 2 fingers up both hands minimize and maximize tabs
* q(exit)
